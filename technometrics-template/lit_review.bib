abstract = {In experiment-based validation, uncertainties and systematic biases in model predictions are reduced by either increasing the amount of experimental evidence available for model calibration—thereby mitigating prediction uncertainty—or increasing the rigor in the definition of physics and/or engineering principles—thereby mitigating prediction bias. Hence, decision makers must regularly choose between either allocating resources for experimentation or further code development. The authors propose a decision-making framework to assist in resource allocation strictly from the perspective of predictive maturity and demonstrate the application of this framework on a nontrivial problem of predicting the plastic deformation of polycrystals.},

abstract = {A new simulation approach, called ‘subset simulation', is proposed to compute small failure probabilities encountered in reliability analysis of engineering systems. The basic idea is to express the failure probability as a product of larger conditional failure probabilities by introducing intermediate failure events. With a proper choice of the conditional events, the conditional failure probabilities can be made sufficiently large so that they can be estimated by means of simulation with a small number of samples. The original problem of calculating a small failure probability, which is computationally demanding, is reduced to calculating a sequence of conditional probabilities, which can be readily and efficiently estimated by means of simulation. The conditional probabilities cannot be estimated efficiently by a standard Monte Carlo procedure, however, and so a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique based on the Metropolis algorithm is presented for their estimation. The proposed method is robust to the number of uncertain parameters and efficient in computing small probabilities. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by calculating the first-excursion probabilities for a linear oscillator subjected to white noise excitation and for a five-story nonlinear hysteretic shear building under uncertain seismic excitation.},

abstract = {Mathematical models, usually implemented in computer programs known as simulators, are widely used in all areas of science and technology to represent complex real-world phenomena. Simulators are often so complex that they take appreciable amounts of computer time or other resources to run. In this context, a methodology has been developed based on building a statistical representation of the simulator, known as an emulator. The principal approach to building emulators uses Gaussian processes. This work presents some diagnostics to validate and assess the adequacy of a Gaussian process emulator as surrogate for the simulator. These diagnostics are based on comparisons between simulator outputs and Gaussian process emulator outputs for some test data, known as validation data, defined by a sample of simulator runs not used to build the emulator. Our diagnostics take care to account for correlation between the validation data. To illustrate a validation procedure, we apply these diagnostics to two different...},

Gaussian process emulators, their advantages and disadvantages, are discussed along with diagnostics to assess successful emulation. The paper discusses both numerical and graphical diagnostics. There is helpful discussion about how to identify what specific problems might be causing poor diagnostic results. Some of the techniques discussed in the paper include the use of standardized prediction errors (from a validation set), the Mahalanobis distance between the emulator and simulator outputs, and variance decompositions. Early in the paper there is a very helpful bit of background/foundation of Gaussian process emulation, including guidance on how to proceed when the observation variance is unknown and must be estimated (and the resulting Student process distribution).},

[Technometrics 49 (2007) 138-154] (and briefly summarized below), based on comparison of computer model runs with field data of the process being modeled. The methodology is particularly suited to treating the major issues associated with the validation process: quantifying multiple sources of error and uncertainty in computer models; combining multiple sources of information; and being able to adapt to different, but related scenarios. Two complications that frequently arise in practice are the need to deal with highly irregular functional data and the need to acknowledge and incorporate uncertainty in the inputs. We develop methodology to deal with both complications. A key part of the approach utilizes a wavelet representation of the functional data, applies a hierarchical version of the scalar validation methodology to the wavelet coefficients, and transforms back, to ultimately compare computer model output with field output. The generality of the methodology is only limited by the capability of a combination of computational tools and the appropriateness of decompositions of the sort (wavelets) employed here. The methods and analyses we present are illustrated with a test bed dynamic stress analysis for a particular engineering system.},

The authors note (p.145) that a non-constant mean function may be called for if you want extrapolation from your GP model. There is some discussion of the trade-offs between using MLEs for hyperparameters or using a full Bayesian analysis; the authors tentatively weigh in for the former option. The authors assert (p. 150) that they have shown that, contrary to common opinion, data can be used simultaneously for calibration/tuning and for model validation, by "incorporating the posterior distribution of the tuning parameters in the overall assessment of uncertainties."},

abstract = {Standard methods in computer model calibration treat the calibration parameters as constant throughout the domain of control inputs. In many applications, systematic variation may cause the best values for the calibration parameters to change between different settings. When not accounted for in the code, this variation can make the computer model inadequate. In this article, we propose a framework for modeling the calibration parameters as functions of the control inputs to account for a computer model's incomplete system representation in this regard while simultaneously allowing for possible constraints imposed by prior expert opinion. We demonstrate how inappropriate modeling assumptions can mislead a researcher into thinking a calibrated model is in need of an empirical discrepancy term when it is only needed to allow for a functional dependence of the calibration parameters on the inputs. We apply our approach to plastic deformation of a visco-plastic self-consistent material in which the critical resolved shear stress is known to vary with temperature.},

abstract = {Science-based simulation models are widely used to predict the behavior of complex physical systems. It is also common to use observations of the physical system to solve the inverse problem, i.e. to learn about the values of parameters within the model, a process often called calibration. The main goal of calibration is usually to improve the predictive performance of the simulator but the values of the parameters in the model may also be of intrinsic scientific interest in their own right. In order to make appropriate use of observations of the physical system it is impor-tant to recognise model discrepancy, the difference between reality and the simulator output. We illustrate through a simple example that an analysis that does not account for model discrepancy may lead to biased and over-confident parameter estimates and predictions. The challenge with incorporating model discrepancy in statistical inverse problems is the confounding with calibration parameters, which will only be resolved with mean-ingful priors. For our simple example, we model the model-discrepancy via a Gaus-sian Process and demonstrate that by accounting for model discrepancy our prediction within the range of data is correct. However, only with realistic priors on the model discrepancy do we uncover the true parameter values. Through theoretical arguments we show that these findings are typical of the general problem of learning about physical parameters and the underlying physical system using science-based mechanistic models.},

The classical Kennedy–O'Hagan approach is widely used for model calibration, which can account for the inadequacy of the computer model while simultaneously estimating the unknown calibration parameters. In many applications, the phenomenon of censoring occurs when the exact outcome of the physical experiment is not observed, but is only known to fall within a certain region. In such cases, the Kennedy–O'Hagan approach cannot be used directly, and we propose a method to incorporate the censoring information when performing model calibration. The method is applied to study the compression phenomenon of liquid inside a bottle. The results show significant improvement over the traditional calibration methods, especially when the number of censored observations is large.

abstract = {"Monte Carlo methods are revolutionizing the on-line analysis of data in fields as diverse as financial modeling, target tracking and computer vision. These methods, appearing under the names of bootstrap filters, condensation, optimal Monte Carlo filters, particle filters and survival of the fittest, have made it possible to solve numerically many complex, non-standard problems that were previously intractable. This book presents the first comprehensive treatment of these techniques, including convergence results and applications to tracking, guidance, automated target recognition, aircraft navigation, robot navigation, econometrics, financial modeling, neural networks, optimal control, optimal filtering, communications, reinforcement learning, signal enhancement, model averaging and selection, computer vision, semiconductor design, population biology, dynamic Bayesian networks, and time series analysis. This will be of great value to students, researchers and practitioners, who have some basic knowledge of probability. Arnaud Doucet received the Ph. D. degree from the University of Paris-XI Orsay in 1997. From 1998 to 2000, he conducted research at the Signal Processing Group of Cambridge University, UK. He is currently an assistant professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering of Melbourne University, Australia. His research interests include Bayesian statistics, dynamic models and Monte Carlo methods. Nando de Freitas obtained a Ph.D. degree in information engineering from Cambridge University in 1999. He is presently a research associate with the artificial intelligence group of the University of California at Berkeley. His main research interests are in Bayesian statistics and the application of on-line and batch Monte Carlo methods to machine learning. Neil Gordon obtained a Ph.D. in Statistics from Imperial College, University of London in 1993.

"Preface This book is intended to have three roles and to serve three associated audiences: an introductory text on Bayesian inference starting from first principles, a graduate text on effective current approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields, and a handbook of Bayesian methods in applied statistics for general users of and researchers in applied statistics. Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"-- Part I: Fundamentals of Bayesian inference.

abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (“annealing”), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel “relaxation” algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

Looks like a great method for dealing with nonstationarity, which also can massively cut back on computational costs.

This is a great paper. Delayed rejection and adaptive Metropolis sampling are both clearly described, as is the DRAM combination of the two. The explanation has theoretical depth but also is clear enough to suffice as a tutorial. Delayed rejection successfully deals with proposals that are too large, and AM deals with proposals that are too small. The combination seems very effective. DR is Markovian but AM is not; DRAM is not either. But like AM, it is ergodic under mild conditions: the target is bounded with bounded support.},

In this paper we introduce an adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm, where the Gaussian proposal distribution is updated along the process using the full information cumulated so far. Due to the adaptive nature of the process, the AM algorithm is non-Markovian, but we establish here that it has the correct ergodic properties. We also include the results of our numerical tests, which indicate that the AM algorithm competes well with traditional Metropolis±Hastings algorithms, and demonstrate that the AM algorithm is easy to use in practical computation.},

The authors make the case for -- essentially -- using the sample covariance of all previous draws as the Gaussian proposal covariance in MCMC. However, it's not MCMC, because it's now Markovian. But according to them under mild conditions it retains all desirable ergodic properties. Seems too good to be true, almost. This paper is an improvement over their 1999 paper, in which they use only a finite number of previous draws.},

The authors extend their 2001 work to focus on high-dimensional cases. The extension is pretty basic: you just apply their AM algorithm componentwise. As in their earlier work, they refer to a scaling factor of 2.4 for the adaptive covariance matrix, and they cite Gelman 1996 for that.
There is an interesting paragraph at the end of section 2 where they talk about rotating the proposal distribution during the burn-in period to improve mixing. The process is well-explained for such a brief little paragraph. I found it helpful.
In reading the paper I found myself wondering: would it be possible to apply a Haario-style adaptive covariance approach to adaptively learn a Gaussian mixture proposal? Perhaps including learning how many Gaussian distributions are in the mixture? That could be very powerful for dealing with multimodality. Just a thought.},

These modern methods often exploit low rank structures and/or multi-core and multi-threaded computing environments to facilitate computation. This study provides, first, an introductory overview of several methods for analyzing large spatial data. Second, this study describes the results of a predictive competition among the described methods as implemented by different groups with strong expertise in the methodology. Specifically, each research group was provided with two training datasets (one simulated and one observed) along with a set of prediction locations. Each group then wrote their own implementation of their method to produce predictions at the given location and each which was subsequently run on a common computing environment. The methods were then compared in terms of various predictive diagnostics. Supplementary materials regarding implementation details of the methods and code are available for this article online.},

Typically, the computer simulation code models a physical system and requires a set of inputs---some known and specified, others unknown. A limited amount of field data from the true physical system is available to inform us about the unknown inputs and also to inform us about the uncertainty that is associated with a simulation-based prediction. The approach given here allows for the following:uncertainty regarding model inputs (i.e., calibration); accounting for uncertainty due to limitations on the number of simulations that can be carried out; discrepancy between the simulation code and the actual physical system; uncertainty in the observation process that yields the actual field data on the true physical system. The resulting analysis yields predictions and their associated uncertainties while accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. We use a Bayesian form...},

This leads to discrepancies in the model predictions. A commonly used statistical approach to overcome this problem is to build a statistical model for the discrepancies between the engineering model and observed data. In contrast, an engineering approach would be to find the causes of discrepancy and fix the engineering model using first principles. However, the engineering approach is time consuming, whereas the statistical approach is fast. The drawback of the statistical approach is that it treats the engineering model as a black box and therefore, the statistically adjusted models lack physical interpretability.

@article{Karagiannis2017,
abstract = {Computer models, aiming at simulating a complex real system, are often calibrated in the light of data to improve performance. Standard calibration methods assume that the optimal values of calibration parameters are invariant to the model inputs. In several real world applications where models involve complex parametrizations whose optimal values depend on the model inputs, such an assumption can be too restrictive and may lead to misleading results. We propose a fully Bayesian methodology that produces input dependent optimal values for the calibration parameters, as well as it characterizes the associated uncertainties via posterior distributions. Central to methodology is the idea of formulating the calibration parameter as a step function whose uncertain structure is modeled properly via a binary treed process. Our method is particularly suitable to address problems where the computer model requires the selection of a sub-model from a set of competing ones, but the choice of the ‘best' sub-model may change with the input values. The method produces a selection probability for each sub-model given the input. We propose suitable reversible jump operations to facilitate the challenging computations. We assess the performance of our method against benchmark examples, and use it to analyze a real world application with a large-scale climate model.},

The authors assert that theirs is the first attempt to model all the sources of uncertainty in calibration of computer models. This despite the fact that theirs is not a full Bayesian analysis; they use MLEs for some hyperparameters. The authors are explicit in considering calibration to be a matter of finding ``best-fitting" values for calibration parameters; that is, calibration is for them hopelessly confounded with minimizing model inadequacy. (For the same reason, they even suggest performing model calibration on parameters whose true physical value is actually known.) In the examples considered by the authors, they integrate by crude quadrature (rather than MCMC).},

Aiming to address the uncertainty arising from the selection of a particular prior, this paper first conducts a study on possible formulations of the model discrepancy function. A first-order Taylor series expansion-based method is developed to investigate the potential redundancy caused by adding a discrepancy function to the original physics model. Further, we propose a three-step (calibration, validation, and combination) approach in order to inform the decision on the construction of model discrepancy priors. In the validation step, a reliability-based metric is used to evaluate posterior model predictions in the validation domain. The validation metric serves as a quantitative measure of how well the discrepancy formulation captures the missing physics in the model. In the combination step, the posterior distributions of model parameters and discrepancy corresponding to different priors are combined into a single distribution based on the probabilistic weights derived from the validation step. The combined distribution acknowledges the uncertainty in the prior formulation of model discrepancy function.},

Before relying on a computer model, a natural first step is often to compare its output with physical or field data, to assess whether the computer model reliably represents the real world. Field data, when available, can also be used to calibrate or tune unknown parameters in the computer model. Calibration is particularly problematic in the presence of systematic discrepancies between the computer model and field observations. We introduce a likelihood alternative to previous Bayesian methodology for estimation of calibration or tuning parameters. In an important special case, we show that maximum likelihood estimation will asymptotically find values of the calibration parameter that give an unbiased computer model, if such a model exists. However, the calibration parameters are not necessarily estimable. We also show in some settings that calibration or tuning need to take into account the end-use prediction strategy. Depending on the strategy, the choice of the parameter values may be critical or unimportant.},

@incollection{Neal2011,
abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) originated with the classic paper of Metropolis et al. (1953), where it was used to simulate the distribution of states for a system of idealized molecules. Not long after, another approach to molecular simulation was introduced (Alder and Wainwright, 1959), in which the motion of the molecules was deterministic, following Newton's laws of motion, which have an elegant formalization as Hamiltonian dynamics. For finding the properties of bulk materials, these approaches are asymptotically equivalent, since even in a deterministic simulation, each local region of the material experiences effectively random influences from distant regions. Despite the large overlap in their appli-cation areas, the MCMC and molecular dynamics approaches have continued to coexist in the following decades (see Frenkel and Smit, 1996). In 1987, a landmark paper by Duane, Kennedy, Pendleton, and Roweth united the MCMC and molecular dynamics approaches. They called their method " hybrid Monte Carlo, " which abbreviates to " HMC, " but the phrase " Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, " retain-ing the abbreviation, is more specific and descriptive, and I will use it here. Duane et al. applied HMC not to molecular simulation, but to lattice field theory simulations of quan-tum chromodynamics. Statistical applications of HMC began with my use of it for neural network models (Neal, 1996a). I also provided a statistically-oriented tutorial on HMC in a review of MCMC methods (Neal, 1993, Chapter 5). There have been other applications of HMC to statistical problems (e.g. Ishwaran, 1999; Schmidt, 2009) and statistically-oriented reviews (e.g. Liu, 2001, Chapter 9), but HMC still seems to be underappreciated by statisticians, and perhaps also by physicists outside the lattice field theory community. This review begins by describing Hamiltonian dynamics. Despite terminology that may be unfamiliar outside physics, the features of Hamiltonian dynamics that are needed for HMC are elementary. The differential equations of Hamiltonian dynamics must be dis-cretized for computer implementation. The " leapfrog " scheme that is typically used is quite simple. Following this introduction to Hamiltonian dynamics, I describe how to use it to con-struct an MCMC method. The first step is to define a Hamiltonian function in terms of the probability distribution we wish to sample from. In addition to the variables we are inter-ested in (the " position " variables), we must introduce auxiliary " momentum " variables, which typically have independent Gaussian distributions. The HMC method alternates simple updates for these momentum variables with Metropolis updates in which a new state is proposed by computing a trajectory according to Hamiltonian dynamics, imple-mented with the leapfrog method. A state proposed in this way can be distant from the 113 114 Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo current state but nevertheless have a high probability of acceptance. This bypasses the slow exploration of the state space that occurs when Metropolis updates are done using a simple random-walk proposal distribution. (An alternative way of avoiding random walks is to use short trajectories but only partially replace the momentum variables between trajectories, so that successive trajectories tend to move in the same direction.) After presenting the basic HMC method, I discuss practical issues of tuning the leapfrog stepsize and number of leapfrog steps, as well as theoretical results on the scaling of HMC with dimensionality. I then present a number of variations on HMC. The acceptance rate for HMC can be increased for many problems by looking at " windows " of states at the beginning and end of the trajectory. For many statistical problems, approximate computa-tion of trajectories (e.g. using subsets of the data) may be beneficial. Tuning of HMC can be made easier using a " short-cut " in which trajectories computed with a bad choice of stepsize take little computation time. Finally, " tempering " methods may be useful when multiple isolated modes exist.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes are a natural way of specifying prior distributions over functions of one or more input variables. When such a function defines the mean response in a regression model with Gaussian errors, inference can be done using matrix computations, which are feasible for datasets of up to about a thousand cases. The covariance function of the Gaussian process can be given a hierarchical prior, which allows the model to discover high-level properties of the data, such as which inputs are relevant to predicting the response. Inference for these covariance hyperparameters can be done using Markov chain sampling. Classification models can be defined using Gaussian processes for underlying latent values, which can also be sampled within the Markov chain. Gaussian processes are in my view the simplest and most obvious way of defining flexible Bayesian regression and classification models, but despite some past usage, they appear to have been rather neglected as a general-purpose technique. This may be partly due to a confusion between the properties of the function being modeled and the properties of the best predictor for this unknown function. In this paper, I hope to persuade you that Gaussian processes are a fruitful way of defining prior distributions for flexible regression and classification models in which the regression or class probability functions are not limited to simple parametric forms. The basic idea goes back many years in a regression context, but is nevertheless not widely appreciated. The use of general Gaussian process models for classification is more recent, and to my knowledge the work presented here is the first that implements an exact Bayesian approach. One attraction of Gaussian processes is the variety of covariance functions one can choose from, which lead to functions with different degrees of smoothness, or different sorts of additive structure. I will describe some of these possibilities, while also noting the limitations of Gaussian processes. I then discuss computations for Gaussian process models, starting with the basic matrix operations involved. For classification models, one must integrate over the ''latent values'' underlying each case. I show how this can be done using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In a full-fledged Bayesian treatment, one must also integrate over the posterior distribution for the hyperparameters of the covariance function, which can also be done using Markov chain sampling. I show how this all works for a synthetic three-way classification problem. The methods I describe are implemented in software that is available from my web page, at http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/radford/. Gaussian processes and related methods have been used in various contexts for many years. Despite this past usage, and despite the fundamental simplicity of the idea, Gaussian process models appear to have been little appreciated by most Bayesians. I speculate that this could be partly due to a confusion between the properties one expects of the true function being modeled and those of the best predictor for this unknown function. Clarity in this respect is particularly important when thinking of flexible models such as those based on Gaussian processes.},

abstract = {Markov chain sampling methods that adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed using the principle that one can sample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal "slice" defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such "slice sampling" methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by "overrelaxation," and for multivariate slice sampling by "reflection" from the edges of the slice.},

abstract = {Inference on large-scale models is of great interest in modern science. Examples include deterministic simulators of fluid dynamics to recover the source of a pollutant, or stochastic agent-based simulators to infer features of consumer behaviour. When computational con-straints prohibit model evaluation at all but a small ensemble of parameter settings, exact in-ference becomes infeasible. In such cases, emulation of the simulator enables the interrogation of a surrogate model at arbitrary parameter values. Combining emulators with observational data to estimate parameters and predict a real-world process is known as computer model calibration. The choice of the emulator model is a critical aspect of calibration. Existing approaches treat the mathematical model as implemented on computer as an unknown but deterministic response surface. However, in many cases the underlying mathematical model, or the simulator approximating the mathematical model, are not determinsitic and in fact have some uncertainty associated with their output. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian statistical calibration model for stochastic simulators. The approach is motivated by two applied problems: a deterministic mathematical model of intra-cellular signalling whose im-plementation on computer nonetheless has discretization uncertainty, and a stochastic model of river water temperature commonly used in hydrology. We show the proposed approach is able to map the uncertainties of such non-deterministic simulators through to the resulting in-ference while retaining computational feasibility.

Many studies of this nature relate outdoor pollution levels measured at a few monitoring sta-tions with health outcomes. Recently, computational methods have been developed to model the distribution of personal exposures, rather than ambient concentration, and then relate the exposure distribution to the health outcome. Although these methods show great promise, they are limited by the computational demands of the exposure model. We propose a method to alle-viate these computational burdens with the eventual goal of implementing a national study of the health effects of air pollution exposure. Our approach is to develop a statistical emulator for the exposure model, i.e. we use Bayesian density estimation to predict the conditional exposure distribution as a function of several variables, such as temperature, human activity and physical characteristics of the pollutant. This poses a challenging statistical problem because there are many predictors of the exposure distribution and density estimation is notoriously difficult in high dimensions. To overcome this challenge, we use stochastic search variable selection to identify a subset of the variables that have more than just additive effects on the mean of the exposure distribution. We apply our method to emulate an ozone exposure model in Philadelphia.},

Often, the codes are computationally expensive to run, and a common objective of an experiment is to fit a cheaper predictor of the output to the data. Our approach is to model the deterministic output as the realization of a stochastic process, thereby providing a statistical basis for designing experiments (choosing the inputs) for efficient prediction. WIth this model, estimates of uncertainty of predictions are also available. Recent work in this area is reviewed, a number of applications are discussed, and we demonstrate our methodology with an example.},

Foundational with respect to much of the work done in computer model calibration. The case is made that despite their deterministic nature, computer models are a proper subject of statistical study, for which we may perform uncertainty analysis. The authors walk through the process of building a Gaussian process emulator of computer code for this purpose. Various covariance functions are discussed. The authors fit covariance function parameters through MLE. Roughly half the paper is devoted to questions of design.},

abstract = {A large number of problems in production planning and scheduling, location, transportation, finance, and engineering design require that decisions be made in the presence of uncertainty. Uncertainty, for instance, governs the prices of fuels, the availability of electricity, and the demand for chemicals. A key difficulty in optimization under uncertainty is in dealing with an uncertainty space that is huge and frequently leads to very large-scale optimization models. Decision-making under uncertainty is often further complicated by the presence of integer decision variables to model logical and other discrete decisions in a multi-period or multi-stage setting. This paper reviews theory and methodology that have been developed to cope with the complexity of optimization problems under uncertainty. We discuss and contrast the classical recourse-based stochastic programming, robust stochastic programming, probabilistic (chance-constraint) programming, fuzzy programming, and stochastic dynamic programming. The advantages and shortcomings of these models are reviewed and illustrated through examples. Applications and the state-of-the-art in computations are also reviewed. Finally, we discuss several main areas for future development in this field. These include development of polynomial-time approximation schemes for multi-stage stochastic programs and the application of global optimization algorithms to two-stage and chance-constraint formulations.},

@book{Santner2003a,
abstract = {The computer has become an increasingly popular tool for exploring the relationship between a measured response and factors thought to affect the response. In many cases, the basis of a computer model is a mathematical theory that implicitly relates the response to the factors. A computer model becomes possible given suitable numerical methods for accurately solving the mathematical system and appropriate computer hardware and software to implement the numerical methods. For example, in many engineering applications, the relationship is described by a dynamical system and the numerical method is a finite element code. The resulting computer "simulator" can generate the response corresponding to any given set of values of the factors. This allows one to use the code to conduct a "computer experiment" to explore the relationship between the response and the factors. In some cases, computer experimentation is feasible when a properly designed physical experiment (the gold standard for establishing cause and effect) is impossible; the number of input variables may be too large to consider performing a physical experiment, or power studies may show it is economically prohibitive to run an experiment on the scale required to answer a given research question. This book describes methods for designing and analyzing experiments that are conducted using a computer code rather than a physical experiment. It discusses how to select the values of the factors at which to run the code (the design of the computer experiment) in light of the research objectives of the experimenter. It also provides techniques for analyzing the resulting data so as to achieve these research goals. It illustrates these methods with code that is available to the reader at the companion web site for the book.

Our specific interest is in the analysis of data sets with predictors that have an a priori unknown form of possibly nonlinear associations to the re-sponse. The modeling approach we describe incorporates Gaussian processes in a generalized linear model framework to obtain a class of nonparametric regression models where the covariance matrix depends on the predictors. We consider, in particular, continuous, categorical and count responses. We also look into models that account for survival outcomes. We explore alterna-tive covariance formulations for the Gaussian process prior and demonstrate the flexibility of the construction. Next, we focus on the important problem of selecting variables from the set of possible predictors and describe a gen-eral framework that employs mixture priors. We compare alternative MCMC strategies for posterior inference and achieve a computationally efficient and practical approach. We demonstrate performances on simulated and bench-mark data sets.},

This paper provides a thorough and helpful discussion of Gaussian process regression before coming to focus specifically on the problem of variable selection in a Gaussian process regression. This is valuable because it allows one to undertake variable selection when one has little notion of what might be the parametric form of the relationship of the potential covariates to the response. The selection is accomplished via spike-and-slab mixture priors. The authors discuss two distinct MCMC schemas for carrying out the variable selection, comparing them with each other and with other methods.},

abstract = {A generalized Gaussian process model (GGPM) is a unifying framework that encompasses many existing Gaussian process (GP) models, such as GP regression, classification, and counting. In the GGPM framework, the observation likelihood of the GP model is itself parameterized using the ex-ponential family distribution (EFD). In this paper, we consider efficient algorithms for approximate inference on GGPMs using the general form of the EFD. A particular GP model and its associ-ated inference algorithms can then be formed by changing the parameters of the EFD, thus greatly simplifying its creation for task-specific output domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of this frame-work by creating several new GP models for regressing to non-negative reals and to real intervals. We also consider a closed-form Taylor approximation for efficient inference on GGPMs, and elab-orate on its connections with other model-specific heuristic closed-form approximations. Finally, we present a comprehensive set of experiments to compare approximate inference algorithms on a wide variety of GGPMs.},

Yielding accurate representations of reality from partitioned models depends on the availability of all necessary constituent models representing relevant physical phenomena.

We examined the cohort differences and socioeconomic patterning in adult height in low- to middle-income countries.   Methods/Findings We analyzed cross-sectional, representative samples of 364538 women aged 25-49 years drawn from 54 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 1994 and 2008. Linear multilevel regression models included year of birth, household wealth, education, and area of residence, and accounted for clustering by primary sampling units and countries. Attained height was measured using an adjustable measuring board. A yearly change in birth cohorts starting with those born in 1945 was associated with a 0.0138 cm (95{\%} CI 0.0107, 0.0169) increase in height. Increases in heights in more recent birth year cohorts were largely concentrated in women from the richer wealth quintiles. 35 of the 54 countries experienced a decline (14) or stagnation (21) in height. The decline in heights was largely concentrated among the poorest wealth quintiles. There was a strong positive association between height and household wealth; those in two richest quintiles of household wealth were 1.988 cm (95{\%} CI 1.886, 2.090) and 1.018 cm (95{\%} CI 0.916, 1.120) taller, compared to those in the poorest wealth quintile. The strength of the association between wealth and height was positive (0.05 to 1.16) in 96{\%} (52/54) countries.   Conclusions Socioeconomic inequalities in height remain persistent. Height has stagnated or declined over the last decades in low- to middle-income countries, particularly in Africa, suggesting worsening nutritional and environmental circumstances during childhood.},

Kennedy and O'Hagan (2001) shows that the calibration method based on Gaussian process models proposed by Kennedy and O'Hagan (2001) may lead to unreasonable estimate for imperfect computer models. In this work, we extend their study to calibration problems with stochastic physical data. We propose a novel method, called the {\$}L{\_}2{\$} calibration, and show its semiparametric efficiency. The conventional method of the ordinary least squares is also studied. Theoretical analysis shows that it is consistent but not efficient. Numerical examples show that the proposed method outperforms the existing ones.},

abstract = {Computer models are mathematical representations of real systems developed for understanding and investigating the systems. They are particularly useful when physical experiments are either cost- prohibitive or time-prohibitive. Before a computer model is used, it often must be validated by comparing the computer outputs with physical experiments. This article proposes a Bayesian approach to validating computer models that overcomes several difficulties of the frequentist approach proposed by Oberkampf and Barone. Kennedy and O'Hagan proposed a similar Bayesian approach. A major difference between their approach and ours is that theirs focuses on directly deriving the posterior of the true output, whereas our approach focuses on first deriving the posteriors of the computer model and model bias (difference between computer and true outputs) separately, then deriving the posterior of the true output. As a result, our approach provides a clear decomposition of the expected prediction error of the true outpu...},

The article's approach is very similar to the Kennedy-O'Hagan approach. The authors compare it to that approach throughout the paper.

These experiments are conducted to learn about the behavior of materials subjected to high strain rate environments. Computer simulations of flyer plate experiments are conducted with a two-dimensional hydro- dynamic code developed under the Advanced Strategic Computing (ASC) program at Los Alamos National Laboratory. This code incorporates physical models that contain parameters having uncertain values. The objectives of the analyses pre- sented in this paper are to assess the sensitivity of free surface velocity to variations in the uncertain inputs, to constrain the values of these inputs to be consistent with experiment, and to predict free surface velocity based on the constrained inputs. We implement a Bayesian approach that combines detailed physics simulations with experimental data for the desired statistical inference (Kennedy and O'Hagan 2001; Higdon, Kennedy, Cavendish, Cafeo, and Ryne 2004).},

abstract = {This paper considers the computer model calibration problem and provides a general frequentist solution. Under the proposed framework, the data model is semi-parametric with a nonparametric discrepancy function which accounts for any discrepancy between the physical reality and the computer model. In an attempt to solve a fundamentally important (but often ignored) identifiability issue between the computer model parameters and the discrepancy function, this paper proposes a new and identifiable parametrization of the calibration problem. It also develops a two-step procedure for estimating all the relevant quantities under the new parameterization. This estimation procedure is shown to enjoy excellent rates of convergence and can be straightforwardly implemented with existing software. For uncertainty quantification, bootstrapping is adopted to construct confidence regions for the quantities of interest. The practical performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated through simulation examples and an application to a computational fluid dynamics model.},

For those not familiar with models for computer experiments, we begin by showing, in a simple setting, that a standard model for computer experiments can be viewed as a generalization of regression models. We then review models that include both quantitative and quantitative variables and present some alternative parameterizations. Two are based on indicator functions and allow one to use standard quantitative inputs-only models. Another parameterization provides additional insight into possible underlying factorial structure. Finally, we use two examples to illustrate the benefits of these alternative models},

The computational efficiency of the technique described in Qian et al 2008 is vastly improved here. However, this version still requires m(m-1)/2 parameters when the qualitative factor has m levels. For a single factor of 1000 materials, that is almost 500,000 variables; for two factors of 20 and 50 levels resp., it is 1415 parameters. Restrictions of the covariance matrix may allow reduction in the number of parameters without too far mitigating the utility of the framework.},

@article{Zuev2012a,
abstract = {Estimation of small failure probabilities is one of the most important and challenging computational problems in reliability engineering. The failure probability is usually given by an integral over a high-dimensional uncertain parameter space that is difficult to evaluate numerically. This paper focuses on enhancements to Subset Simulation (SS), proposed by Au and Beck, which provides an efficient algorithm based on MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) simulation for computing small failure probabilities for general high-dimensional reliability problems. First, we analyze the Modified Metropolis algorithm (MMA), an MCMC technique, which is used in SS for sampling from high-dimensional conditional distributions. The efficiency and accuracy of SS directly depends on the ergodic properties of the Markov chains generated by MMA, which control how fast the chain explores the parameter space. We present some observations on the optimal scaling of MMA for efficient exploration, and develop an optimal scaling strategy for this algorithm when it is employed within SS. Next, we provide a theoretical basis for the optimal value of the conditional failure probability p0, an important parameter one has to choose when using SS. We demonstrate that choosing any $p_0\in[0.1,0.3]$ will give similar efficiency as the optimal value of p0. Finally, a Bayesian post-processor SS+ for the original SS method is developed where the uncertain failure probability that one is estimating is modeled as a stochastic variable whose possible values belong to the unit interval. Simulated samples from SS are viewed as informative data relevant to the system's reliability. Instead of a single real number as an estimate, SS+ produces the posterior PDF of the failure probability, which takes into account both prior information and the information in the sampled data. This PDF quantifies the uncertainty in the value of the failure probability and it may be further used in risk analyses to incorporate this uncertainty. To demonstrate SS+, we consider its application to two different reliability problems: a linear reliability problem and reliability analysis of an elasto-plastic structure subjected to strong seismic ground motion. The relationship between the original SS and SS+ is also discussed.},

abstract = {Activities such as global sensitivity analysis, statistical effect screening, uncertainty propagation, or model calibration have become integral to the Verification and Validation (V{\&}V) of numerical models and computer simulations. One of the goals of V{\&}V is to assess prediction accuracy and uncertainty, which feeds directly into reliability analysis or the Quantification of Margin and Uncertainty (QMU) of engineered systems. Because these analyses involve multiple runs of a computer code, they can rapidly become computationally expensive. An alternative to Monte Carlo-like sampling is to combine a design of computer experiments to meta-modeling, and replace the potentially expensive computer simulation by a fast-running emulator. The surrogate can then be used to estimate sensitivities, propagate uncertainty, and calibrate model parameters at a fraction of the cost it would take to wrap a sampling algorithm or optimization solver around the physics-based code. Doing so, however, offers the risk to develop an incorrect emulator that erroneously approximates the “true-but-unknown” sensitivities of the physics-based code. We demonstrate the extent to which this occurs when Gaussian Process Modeling (GPM) emulators are trained in high-dimensional spaces using too-sparsely populated designs-of-experiments. Our illustration analyzes a variant of the Rosenbrock function in which several effects are made statistically insignificant while others are strongly coupled, therefore, mimicking a situation that is often encountered in practice. In this example, using a combination of GPM emulator and design-of-experiments leads to an incorrect approximation of the function. A mathematical proof of the origin of the problem is proposed. The adverse effects that too-sparsely populated designs may produce are discussed for the coverage of the design space, estimation of sensitivities, and calibration of parameters. This work attempts to raise awareness to the potential dangers of not allocating enough resources when exploring a design space to develop fast-running emulators.},

abstract = {Several plausible modeling strategies are available to develop numerical models for simulating the dynamics of wind turbine blades. While the modeling strategy is typically selected according to expert judgment, the “best” modeling approach is unknown to the model developer. Thus, comparing plausible modeling strategies through a systematic and rigorous approach becomes necessary. This manuscript departs from the conventional approach that selects the model with the highest fidelity-to-data; and instead explores the trade-off between fidelity of model predictions to experiments and robustness of model predictions to model imprecision and inexactness. Exploring robustness in addition to fidelity lends credibility to the model, ensuring model predictions can be trusted even when lack-of-knowledge in the modeling assumptions and/or input parameters result in unforeseen errors and uncertainties. This concept is demonstrated on the CX-100 wind turbine blade in an experimental configuration with large masses added to load the blade in bending during vibration testing. The finite element model of the blade is built with shell elements and validated against experimental evidence, while the large masses are modeled according to two different, but plausible strategies using (i) a combination of point-mass and spring elements, and (ii) solid elements. These two modeling strategies are evaluated considering both the fidelity of the natural frequency predictions against experiments, and the robustness of the predicted natural frequencies to uncertainties in the input parameters. By considering robustness during model selection, the authors determine the extent to which prediction accuracy deteriorates as the lack-of-knowledge increases. The findings suggest the model with solid elements offers a higher degree of fidelity-to-data and robustness to uncertainties, thus providing a superior modeling strategy than the model with point masses and stiffening springs.},

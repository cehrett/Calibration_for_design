## Abstract: 
In traditional engineering design, material selection involves choosing a material
with appropriate properties from a database of known materials, often as a matter
of ad-hoc satiscing. Material design usually occurs separately, and without an eye
to specic end-uses. We wed these design processes, selecting a material design by
modeling its performance outcomes in a particular engineering application. We show
that existing techniques for model calibration can be protably reconceptualized as
a method for optimization and applied to solve this material design problem. We
demonstrate by calibrating material design parameters to desired performance targets
for a wind turbine blade.
